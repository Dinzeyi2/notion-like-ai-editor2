AT&T Inc. T is scheduled to report third-quarter 2024 earnings before the opening bell on Oct. 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $30.55 billion and 59 cents per share, respectively. Earnings estimates for AT&T for 2024 have remained steady at $2.22 per share over the past 30 days, while the same for 2025 has jumped to $2.35 from $2.34 per share. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Earnings Surprise History The communications service provider delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.5%, on average.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Factors Shaping the Upcoming Results AT&T continues to enhance its network infrastructure, including 5G and fiber networks, to provide best-in-class coverage and capacity across the nation. The infrastructure investments position it for growth by ensuring widespread access to its services. AT&T's commitment to closing the digital divide underscores its dedication to fostering inclusive connectivity and driving socio-economic progress as the digital landscape evolves.  With a customer-centric business model, AT&T is likely to benefit from the increased deployment of mid-band spectrum and greater fiber densification. An integrated fiber expansion strategy is expected to improve broadband connectivity for enterprise and consumer markets, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. During the quarter, AT&T entered into a definitive agreement with Unsupervised AI to unearth potential opportunities to improve key metrics while empowering its workforce with faster, smarter access to data insights. The deal with this Broomfield, CO-based software firm will enable AT&T to leverage AI (artificial intelligence) to help identify valuable patterns and key insights by analyzing various internal data sources to scale production and improve profitability. This is expected to identify more than $100 million worth of opportunities that could be deployed across the diverse business units of AT&T to augment its ROI (return on investments).  AT&T also collaborated with Oracle Corporation ORCL to support varied industry applications and deliver robust real-time communications. Oracle will integrate AT&T’s IoT connectivity and network APIs with its Enterprise Communications Platform to include features like IoT edge application management, simplifying complex integrations and network contracts for customers. Powered by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, this unified system offers businesses the reliable connectivity and real-time data they need to drive new, essential services and experiences. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues for the Communications segment.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Communications segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, is pegged at $29.3 billion, while our model projects revenues of $29.24 billion. However, AT&T faces stiff competition in the wireless market from other major carriers that are aggressively expanding their networks and improving their offerings. Consumer’s tendency to switch to various low-priced alternatives is hurting the company’s top line. It also has a large debt burden, which dents its competitiveness and limits growth potential. In addition, a challenging macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and business uncertainty are forcing consumers to have a conservative approach to higher-tier services.  Moreover, AT&T is facing a steady decline in legacy services. The company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. High-speed Internet revenues are contracting due to the legacy Digital Subscriber Line decline, simplified pricing and bundle discounts. As AT&T tries to woo customers with healthy discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to escalate, affecting its growth potential to some extent. Price PerformanceOver the past year, AT&T has gained 46.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 50.4%, outperforming peers like Verizon Communications Inc. VZ but lagging T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS. Key Valuation MetricFrom a valuation standpoint, AT&T appears to be trading relatively cheaper than the industry but well above its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 9.41 forward earnings, lower than 12.56 for the industry but higher than the stock’s mean of 8.14. Investment Considerations With a customer-centric business model, AT&T is likely to benefit from the increased deployment of mid-band spectrum and greater fiber densification. For a seamless transition among Wi-Fi, Long-Term Evolution and 5G services, AT&T intends to deploy a standards-based nationwide mobile 5G network. Its 5G service entails utilization of millimeter wave spectrum for deployment in dense pockets while in suburban and rural areas, it intends to deploy 5G on mid- and low-band spectrum holdings. It believes that as the 5G ecosystem evolves, customers can experience significant enhancements in coverage, speeds and devices.  However, spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry with a saturated wireless market. Most carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become even more acute with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services. A steady decline in legacy services and uncertain business conditions are likely to affect its profitability. End Note With a Zacks Rank #3, AT&T appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. A saturated wireless market and price wars owing to competitive pressure have further eroded its profitability. Consequently, it might not be prudent to bet on the stock at the moment. However, a single quarter’s results are not so important for long-term stakeholders, and investors already owning the stock could stay put. By investing steadily in infrastructure and pioneering new technologies, AT&T is well-positioned to bridge the digital divide and enhance the connectivity landscape nationwide. This is likely to translate into solid postpaid subscriber growth and higher average revenue per user in the Mobility Service business. These, in turn, offer some enticing reasons for staying invested in the stock over the long term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here is another example of a technologie blog. user : “  write me an article about WiseTech Sinks Claiming  Billionaire CEO’s Inappropriate Behavior “  you : “ WiseTech Sinks on Claims of Billionaire CEO’s Inappropriate Behavior (Bloomberg) -- WiseTech Global Ltd. shares plunged in Sydney after the tech company’s board said it’s reviewing media allegations against billionaire co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Richard White of historical inappropriate behavior. The stock closed down 15%, the biggest decline in more than a year. The move wiped $1.4 billion off White’s wealth to $8.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. White, 70, is WiseTech’s largest shareholder and has run the company since 1994, turning it into a global supply-chain powerhouse through a series of acquisitions. Nine Entertainment Co. publications The Australian Financial Review, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age said Monday that White had paid millions of dollars to a former sexual partner to settle allegations made in late 2020. The newspapers said White had provided a board subcommittee with a statutory declaration denying the claims. The newspapers said they’re not suggesting the allegations are true, only that they were made. Media stories making various claims about White’s personal relationships with women have swirled in Australia for the past three weeks, but the statement from WiseTech’s board on Monday and the market reaction raises the stakes. The company’s dominant shareholder — and the board’s governance controls — are now in the corporate spotlight for the first time “The board is currently reviewing the full range of matters raised in today’s media reports and is actively seeking further information and taking external advice,” WiseTech’s directors said in a statement. “It is conscious of the potential impacts on the company and will carefully evaluate all relevant factors in its assessment.” Monday’s stock slump cut WiseTech’s market value by about A$6 billion ($4 billion) to A$35 billion. The stock has soared since its 2016 initial public offering, turning White into one of Australia’s richest people. A spokesperson for WiseTech referred all questions to a representative for White’s lawyers, who didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking a response from White. Only two current WiseTech directors were on the board at the time the allegations were made, and the company held a series of crisis meetings over the weekend, according to the reports. “These allegations are a major concern for investors,” said Ed John, executive manager of stewardship at the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents some of the country’s largest pension funds. “It is critical that the board investigates these issues on behalf of all WiseTech shareholders and responds appropriately.” Subscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen. WiseTech is a key provider of the software that coordinates shipping across the world. The Australian company claims the majority of the world’s biggest global logistics providers and freight forwarders among its clients, including DHL, China’s Sinotrans, Japan’s Nippon Express and APL Logistics. The reports on Monday also alleged that leaked communications from 2019 between WiseTech directors showed governance concerns over White’s decision to pay a former female executive A$2.7 million, double what he was earning as CEO, without disclosing this to investors. “ this is the kind of blog generated by edom, it’s informative , very human form , very educative , and more , that’s how edom should always generated blogs. here is another example :user : “ write a blog about about a person who, after a heartfelt conversation with a friend, realizes how much they've unintentionally distanced themselves from those who care about them. The friend, in a gentle yet emotional plea, expresses how much they miss spending time together. The author reflects on how depression, stress, and life challenges had caused them to withdraw, even from relationships that had been a source of comfort and joy. Through this interaction, the author is reminded of the importance of friendship, connection, and being vulnerable enough to lean on others. The story ends with renewed hope and plans to reconnect over shared interests and bubble tea. “ You : “  title : We Haven’t Hung Out in Months. Please Do Something About It. yesterday, a friend of mine turned around at the door after we had hugged goodbye, walked back across the room towards me, and said:“Evin, we haven’t hung out in months. Please do something about it. Please. Maybe we can go for bubble tea again.” And then she was gone.Her words stung. They stung because those words were so kind, so gentle, and so pleading. They shocked me because I’d had no idea she felt this way. I hadn’t realized how much she missed me. And if I were being honest, her words also thrilled me. In places I’ve lived like America or the UK, I can go for months without seeing people I consider to be good friends. Asking someone out for a casual dinner is a rarity because of busy schedules and living on opposite ends of a city. And giving the appearance of needing someone… well, that’s just asking for trouble in Western society, isn’t it? Who would want someone needy and dependent as a friend? But here I was, being told firmly that my absence was a situation to be rectified. And I was so grateful for it. It has been a hard summer. I live in Iraq, where daytime temperatures soar to 45 Celcius for months at a time. Unlike other parts of the world, summer is not the time for friends, family, and fun. Summer is the time to stay indoors and become a social recluse. I didn’t intend to stop visiting my friend. But logistics had gotten in the way of spending time together easily. And yes, I had dropped the ball. But to be fair, I’d had no idea my past visits meant so much. Her sister, who was sitting beside me, responded to my surprise with something akin to indignation. “Of course we’ve missed you! You were coming to visit us every week and suddenly you stopped coming. How can you believe you are not a part of our lives?” The only defense I could offer up was that sometimes my depression robbed me of the ability to see the friends I had around me. I couldn’t blame the summer. That was like blaming the sun for shining. It was something everyone had to live through. But as I chewed on my friend’s words, a memory crystallized, transferring slowly from unconscious to conscious awareness. There had been a day at the beginning of summer when I had visited these two friends simply because I was so depressed and I knew that being with these two friends required no pressure, no triggers, no stress. We had watched an anime movie together, and the depression had lifted ever so slightly. I had felt so bad when I went home; to my mind, I had been using my friends for personal gain. If a relationship is not equitable, is it even worth it? It was unbearable — this knowledge that I had taken advantage of my friends. That my friends had needed to hold more of me than I had been prepared to let them. I realize now that I had made an unconscious — and obviously wrong — choice to pull away. To hide out in my new home where I didn’t have to worry about emotional responsibilities and I could depend on other things to regulate my nervous system. Like binge-watching Slow Horses and writing on Medium. Things that didn’t make demands on other people. It didn’t register to me that these friends of mine wanted to be leaned on. My depression and needs didn’t faze them. They wanted me to need them because that’s exactly what friends are for. My friends are refugees, living in a country that doesn’t want them and unable to return home because their government cannot protect them. My situation is nowhere close to theirs — I have a coveted passport and can travel pretty much anywhere. Yet within the borders of Iraq, our lives can appear very similar. We deal with the same loneliness, xenophobia, sexism, power cuts, and “I didn’t choose to live here” feeling. Perhaps it’s one of the reasons why we bonded years ago. Living in a former warzone is rough; there’s no sugarcoating it. But I had allowed my gathered resentment and pain to rob me of one important thing: the ability to see people around me who did care about me. And not only people who care, but who see me as a friend and an equal — not as their boss, or their boss’ wife, or as someone to be pitied or patronized, or a reduction of my race or nationality. It’s for this reason that these two friends have always felt precious to me. But for the first time that day, I felt it — deep inside. I am precious to them, too. I am more aware now that my relentless discomfort of being out of place, never belonging and never feeling completely safe means that I’m always looking for an out, a reason to leave. In this default state of mind, I am not constantly scanning my environment for negative things that confirm my inclination to find an escape. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see any of the beauty that exists alongside — and in spite of — all the ugly. I, who have always prided myself in having superior EQ, had been missing some very big green flags in front of me. In the end, we did go to a bubble tea cafe for lunch. We ordered chai milk latte because I didn’t have enough cash for bubble tea, but it was just as good. My friend clearly didn’t care what we drank, only that we were chilling in a cafe together, talking about the big and small things of life — Asian food, anime, Pride and Prejudice, work politics. I introduced her to Medium. She told me she had been having an idea of a book story since the beginning of the year, a fictional story about a Syrian girl. Something based on her life but not autobiographical. We made a plan to return next month to the same cafe we were at and have a writer’s session, working on our respective projects and sharing feedback over bubble tea. Just the thought of that made me feel hopeful. I have forgotten how much I need these friendships. I have ruled out so many people who are willing to be my support system, simply because I was too focused on all the things I didn’t have. And it’s moments like that one yesterday when my friend turned around and retraced her steps towards me, that I remember — I am not alone. “ this is how you write an article , you are edom and you write articles like no one else in this world. here is another example : user : “ write a blog about a person reflecting on their 40th birthday, sharing life lessons they've learned over the past 20 years. A decade ago, they wrote about how to survive your 20s and thrive in your 30s, and now they offer 40 valuable insights they wish they had known when they were younger. The lessons cover a wide range of topics—from relationships, self-respect, and success, to personal responsibility and long-term growth—encouraging readers to focus on personal development, take control of their lives, and embrace both the joys and challenges of adulthood. “ you : “ Title : 40 Life Lessons I Know at 40 (That I Wish I Knew at 20) Today is my 40th birthday. When I turned 30 a decade ago, I wrote an article sharing life lessons to survive your 20s and crowd-sourced advice on how to excel in your 30s. And apparently you guys loved it. So, here’s more of the good stuff: 40 life lessons I now know at 40 that I wish I knew at 20. Dig in. 1. Your Relationship With Others Is a Direct Reflection of Your Relationship With Yourself If you treat yourself poorly, then you will also unconsciously seek out and tolerate others who treat you poorly. If you treat yourself with dignity and respect, then you will only tolerate others who treat you with dignity and respect. Get right with yourself, get right with the world. 2. The Only Way to Feel Better About Yourself Is to Do Things Worth Feeling Good About Respect is earned, not given. 3. The Only Failure Is Not Trying The only rejection is not asking. The only mistake is not risking anything. Success and failure are fuzzy concepts that only exist in your mind before you do something. Not after. After the fact, everything will be a mixture of both. The only real failure is doing nothing. 4. No One Is Coming to Save You No single thing will solve all your problems. No goal, no achievement, no relationship. No one will ever fix you. You will always feel mildly inadequate and somewhat dissatisfied with your life. Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way. On the contrary, it might be the most normal thing about you. 5. Be the Partner You Want to Have If you want a healthy and fit partner, then be healthy and fit yourself. If you want a loyal and trustworthy partner, then be loyal and trustworthy yourself. To put it another way, would you date you? If not, then that’s a fucking problem. 6. The Most Valuable Things in Life Compound Over a Long Period of Time I’m talking about health, wealth, knowledge, confidence, relationships. These things will frustrate you when you’re young because they are slow. But if you start building them from a young age and you don’t stop, by the time you’re in your 30s and 40s you will have an incredible life. 7. The Most Sexy and Exciting Things in Life Are the Opposite These things start out extremely fun, but then have intense diminishing returns. When you’re young, these things distract you and occupy a lot of your time and attention. I’m talking about social media, casual sex, drugs and alcohol, video games, gambling, vacations, and blowjobs. The first time is incredible. The second time is almost as good. But then it’s all downhill from there. Be sure to experience all of these things for a little bit, but then quickly move on. Well, except the blowjobs. Don’t move on from the blowjobs. 8. If You’re Not Turning Down Things That Excite You, Then You’re Not Focused Enough on What Matters Our world is overflowing with stimulation and opportunity. If you aren’t struggling to turn down options, then you haven’t correctly prioritized what matters to you. 9. Taking Responsibility for All of Your Problems Alleviates More Suffering Than It Creates Most people assume that if you take responsibility for all the pain in your life, then you will just feel worse about it. But the opposite is actually true. The more responsibility you take, the more you empower yourself to actually do something about that pain. That’s because… 10. You Give Power to Who You Blame When you blame someone else for your problems, you’re giving them power over you. You’re allowing them to define and dictate your happiness and well-being. This is fucking stupid, so don’t do it. It’s not worth it. 11. If You Have to Tell Someone You’re That, Then You’re Not That A rich man doesn’t feel the need to show people he’s rich. A smart man doesn’t feel the need to tell people he’s smart. A confident person doesn’t have to show people he’s confident. He just is. Don’t say it. Be it. 12. Motivation Is Not the Cause of Action, but the Effect If you want to feel motivated to do something, take the smallest action towards doing it. Then let the momentum carry you forward. 13. Love Is Not the Cause of Commitment, but the Effect You don’t wait until you have a perfect relationship to commit to a person. You commit to the person in order to create the perfect relationship. 14. Passion Is Not the Cause of Good Work, but the Effect You don’t wait until you find something you love doing. You learn to do something well, and the process of developing competency and agency then causes you to become passionate about it. 15. The Person You Marry Is the Person You Fight With The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice. Whatever makes us feel good will inevitably also make us feel bad. 16. A Happy Life Is Not a Life Without Stress. It’s a Life of Meaningful Stress Nuff said. 17. Don’t View Exercise as an Exchange for Something You don’t work out to lose a few pounds or earn that hamburger or an ice cream. With this mindset, you will lose motivation quickly and quit. Instead, view exercise as an investment. For every unit of energy you put in, you will receive multiple units of energy back. The catch is that these units of energy you get back will be spread out over weeks, months, and years. This is why exercising hardcore occasionally is far inferior to exercising a little bit every day. 18. Trust People Most people are good. And while you might get hurt or embarrassed sometimes, the alternative is just way worse. 19. There’s No Such Thing as a Life Without Problems Warren Buffett has money problems. A homeless guy has money problems. Buffett’s money problems are way more desirable than the homeless guy’s. But problems don’t just disappear, they get exchanged and upgraded for better problems as you grow and evolve. The solution to today’s problem will be the seed of tomorrow’s. Set your expectations accordingly. 20. Growth Is Rarely Accompanied by Joy and Celebration On the contrary, growth is usually painful to some degree. That’s because growth requires loss — a loss of your old values, your old behaviors, your old loves, your old identity. Change always has a component of grief to it, so be sure to let yourself grieve. 21. Fuck Being Normal Statistically speaking, a normal person is physically unhealthy, emotionally anxious and depressed, socially lonely, and financially in debt. So yeah, fuck being normal. 22. If You Can’t Say No, Then Your Yeses Mean Nothing We are defined by what we give up, what we sacrifice, and what we reject. If you sacrifice nothing and reject nothing, then you have no identity. You are merely a reflection of the preferences and demands of the people around you. In other words, if you don’t decide who you are, other people will decide for you. 23. Be Careful How You Define Yourself Your identity is a self-constructed mental prison, confining you to a life of desperately seeking and finding things to validate whatever you’ve chosen to become. Define yourself as loosely and ambiguously as possible. You will feel less defensive towards the world and be willing to change when it’s necessary. 24. Don’t Make Assumptions About People You have no fucking idea what they’ve been through. Don’t make assumptions about yourself either. Chances are you have no idea what you’re talking about. The last person we’re objective about is ourselves. 25. No One Thinks About You as Much as You Think About Yourself Whatever you’re insecure about, chances are 99% of people around you haven’t even noticed it. This is because everybody else is too busy thinking about themselves. This may strike you as a little bit depressing, but it’s actually liberating. It means that you are judged far less than you think. 26. Confidence Does Not Come From an Expectation of Success. It Comes From a Comfort With Failure There’s a word for someone who feels a need to succeed in everything: a fucking narcissist. Don’t be a narcissist. Embrace your flaws. Embrace failure. 27. Develop a Willingness to Be Disliked This will grant you the freedom to do what needs to be done, even if it’s unpopular. 28. You Cannot Be a Life-Changing Presence to Some People Without Also Being a Complete Fucking Joke to Others Part of the price of having impact is some hate. And usually that hate is proportional to the impact. 29. Floss and Wear Sunscreen Every Day Look, I know I sound like your mom right now, but trust me, in 20 years you’re going to be thanking me. 30. Extraordinary Results Come From Repeating Ordinary Actions Over an Inordinate Amount of Time Any overnight success is secretly the result of quietly working in obscurity for years, if not decades. 31. Choosing a Partner Is Not About Romance You’re also choosing a confidant, counselor, career advisor, therapist, investor, teacher, travel buddy, roommate, best friend, business partner. And no, I’m not saying you should make your partner be all these things. I’m saying whether you want to or not, your partner is going to become all of these things. That’s what a relationship is. So choose fucking wisely. 32. Don’t Overestimate Romantic Love Love doesn’t fix relationship problems. It doesn’t make trust issues go away. The truth is, love can harm as much as it heals. It’s an amplifier. It makes a good relationship better and a bad relationship much worse. Don’t get me wrong, love is great. Love is beautiful when it works. But to make a healthy relationship, by itself love is not enough. 33. Trust Is the Currency of All Relationships Every good relationship is built off the back of years of trust. Every failed relationship fails because of broken trust. Therefore, honesty and integrity are the backbones of a life of healthy relationships and therefore happiness. Dishonesty and a lack of integrity might be a shortcut to some short-term gains, but you’re completely fucking yourself in the long run, so fucking stop it. Speaking of which… 34. If All of Your Relationships Have the Same Problem… Newsflash: you’re the fucking problem. 35. There’s No Such Thing as a Bad Emotion, Only a Bad Response to an Emotion Every emotion can be used constructively or destructively. One of the most useful things you can ever learn in your life is to figure out how to channel your negative emotions constructively. 36. Go to Bed and Wake Up Early My whole life, I always promised myself I would never be that guy who went to bed at 9PM on a Friday and got up at 5AM to hit the fucking gym. But kids, I hate to tell you, mornings are the real shit. Sorry. 37. You Don’t Have to Prove Anything to Anyone, Including Yourself Let me say that again: you don’t have to prove anything to anyone, including yourself. 38. Life Advice Is Like Clothing Try it on. And if it doesn’t fit, discard it and try something else. Also: like clothing, bad advice will be useless within a few weeks, but good advice will last you a lifetime. 39. Nothing Meaningful in Life Is Easy, Nothing Easy in Life Is Meaningful We think we’d like to have everything handed to us on a silver platter. But the truth is that we don’t appreciate or enjoy things that we don’t struggle for. So stop avoiding the difficult things in your life and instead find the difficult things you enjoy. And finally… 40. It’s Never Too Late to Change A friend of mine once told me a story about his grandmother. He said that when her husband died, she was 62 and for the first time in her life, she began to take piano lessons. For weeks, she practiced all day, every day. At first, the family thought it was just a phase, a way for her to process her grief. But months went by and she continued to play every day. People started to wonder if she was crazy or something was wrong with her. They told her to give it up, face reality. But she kept going. By the time she was in her 90s, she’d been playing piano every day for over 30 years, longer than most professional musicians have been alive. She had mastered all of the classics — Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Vivaldi. Everyone who heard her play swore that she must have been a concert pianist in her youth. No one believed her when she said that she took her first lesson in her 60s. I love this story because it shows that even at an impractical old age, you still have more time left to learn something than most professionals at that thing have even been alive. I didn’t start writing until I was 27. I didn’t start my YouTube channel until I was 36. In every phase of my life, I’ve started five to ten years later than most people. Yet it didn’t matter. I get emails all the time from people asking me, hey, I’m 20 or 40 or 60 or 80, is it too late? Can I change? Is there time? The answer is it’s never too late. There’s always time. The only question is how long we’re going to sit here and make excuses and pretend there’s not.” This is the kind of blogs that edom can generate based on simple prompts, be inspired by how these example blogs are written because that is exactly how you can write blogs.

There’s one important factor that drives markers up and down: liquidity. And if you can measure the divergence between the existing liquidity and the stock market — you have a crystal ball. 🔮 If you need some background: I’ve extensively discussed how the US M2 money supply—the best measure for liquidity—is correlated to the stock market. I’ve also explored how the FED decisions affect liquidity and how this liquidity affects the markets. But in a nutshell, all you need to know is that: All countries have central banks, and they all print money. We will focus on the US Federal Reserve. When the FED prints money, there is more liquidity in the markets. This is measured by the “M2 money supply.” When the markets have more liquidity (i.e. higher M2), investors will allocate part of it to stocks and other assets, such as crypto. This results in the US stock market having a 94% correlation with the M2 money supply: Chart with M2 money supply and S&P 500 correlation. The 10-year correlation coefficient between the SP& 500 and the M2 money supply is 94%. Chart from TradingView. If the FED prints money, markets go up — very simple. Now, we know that the M2 money supply and market behavior are highly correlated, but how can we use this information? Can we profit from it? Can we time it? The answer is yes! The Indicator that Perfectly Times the Market The concept of my new indicator is simple. The Money Flow Divergence indicator measures the divergence (or “gap”) between the growth rates of the M2 money supply and the S&P 500 (SPX) index — it helps you understand the relationship between monetary supply growth and stock market performance. Chart with the the Money Flow Divergence indicator timing the market. The Money Flow Divergence indicator. Created by the author Henrique Centieiro. Chart from TradingView. Using this indicator, we can spot periods of divergence between economic liquidity and market movements. The indicator’s key output is the Growth Divergence, which is the difference between the M2 and S&P 500 growth rates: Growth Divergence = M2 Growth − S&P500 Growth This divergence/gap shows whether liquidity growth is outpacing or lagging behind market growth. And you guessed it: If liquidity growth is outpacing market growth, it’s time to buy! 📈 As you can see in the chart above, the market moves up after those long green bars. The long green bars represent liquidity growth, outpacing market growth. Stanley Druckenmiller quote on liquidity. I have to agree with the master, Stanley Druckenmiller. Image by the author. Okay, so how profitable can this indicator be? Backtesting Results: Beat the Market by 1000%+? See It to Believe It To prove (or disprove) that my Money Flow Divergence indicator works, I’ve created a bot that creates a buy order every time we have one of those green bars (i.e., the liquidity is outpacing the stock market). It’s a simple buy and hold strategy. When the histogram bars are green, it indicates that the M2 Money Supply is growing faster than the S&P 500 index. This means that there is ample liquidity in the economy, which will support stock market growth. So let’s see what happens if we place a buy order every time the indicator has a bar higher than 5 (i.e., the M2 outpaced the stock market by at least 5%.) Here are the results from our bot: Stock market backtesting results for the money flow indicator. The Money Flow Divergence indicator. Created by the author Henrique Centieiro. Screenshot from TradingView. We got amazing returns. I know there’s a lot to digest here, but bear with me. 🐻 You see the S&P500 and buy orders (blue arrows) on the top. In the middle, you see the indicator. The good times to buy are the long green bars. At the bottom is the strategy results. The average trade returned 88%. Not bad, right? I backtested the indicator back to 1970, i.e. 50 years, and the results are consistently impressive. By quantifying the relationship between liquidity and market performance, it gives you the ability to time your trades with remarkable precision. I cannot squeeze the S&P 500 from 1970 until now in a chart, but here are 15 years of it. Observe how the indicator can almost precisely time each bottom: Timing market dips and crashes with the TradingView indicator. The Money Flow Divergence indicator.

Every time the market drops, the M2 magnetic powers bring it up. How to Supercharge the Money Flow Divergence Indicator If you want to stick to traditional S&P 500 index funds/ETFs, that’s totally fine. However, I’ve decided to test my indicator with other assets; the results can be crazy impressive! As you already might know by reading my previous articles on leveraged ETFs, here, here, here and here, I’m a big fan investment strategies using leveraged ETFs. So, I’ve decided to test my new Money Flow Divergence Indicator and see how it would perform with leveraged ETFs such as UPRO (3x S&P 500) and TQQQ (3x Nasdaq). I have to say that I love the results. Using the strategy of buying UPRO with the indicator would return 572% in 10 years, transforming $1,000 into $5,720. On average, each trade would return 220%: Backtesting the Money Flow Divergence on the UPRO ETF. The Money Flow Divergence indicator. Created by the author Henrique Centieiro.

With this strategy, TQQQ would have returned 1,048% in the same 10-year period, while the average trade returned 358%: 🤯 Backtesting the Money Flow Divergence on TQQQ.

I can already hear some of you saying, “Oh, but leveraged ETFs are not good for long-term investing, and they are too volatile.” Look, leveraged ETFs are like coffee with a triple shot of espresso — great if you know when to drink it, but it’s a bad idea right before bed (i.e., right before a market crash). If you buy a leveraged ETF like UPRO or TQQQ right before a market crash, you would indeed suffer dearly. However, with my Money Flow Divergence Indicator, you never buy at the top — you always buy at the bottom. The strategy would even work with Bitcoin (yes, Bitcoin is also highly correlated with M2). I’m not going to post more charts, but over the last 10 years, the average Bitcoin trade with the strategy has returned 6,200%: Backtesting results with Bitcoin. Screenshot from the strategy backtesting on Bitcoin. Out of the 34 trades opened by the strategy, 33 were winning trades, and only 1 was a losing trade. “But, Henrique, are you using the strategy? Or is this article just clickbait?” I’ve been buying all the assets mentioned in this article: SPX (S&P 500), UPRO, TQQQ, and Bitcoin. So yes, I do have my money where my mouth is. Additionally, I will place more buy orders whenever the indicator gives me a nice fat green bar. 📈 Get Started — How do I Get Access to the Money Flow Divergence Indicator?
